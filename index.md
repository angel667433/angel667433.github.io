### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    The second part of lab 4 was my favorite because creating a guessing game was very enjoyable. This lab allowed me to practice using if statements on the inputs both players put in order to make a game that was able to tell the player if the answer of the guesser was too high or too low all with the power of if statements.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was very interesting to me because of the challenge presented by creating the functions to detect when a person can park on certain streets. It was interesting having to combine both or along with and to my if statements to correctly decide whether parking is allowed on a certain street.

* Lab 8


    The second part of lab 8 had a fun final output that was enjoyable to create with my partner. It was the first time I used code to make any shape or pattern and the way the loops had to be methodically thought out with how it was nested and how arguments inside the for loop were done in order to create such a cool pattern made it a fun and fulfilling.
